  <!-- have the browser load the wasm-loading js instead of the typescript compiler

    Though it would compile, it doesn't work. The code that references it finds DebuggerInit
    undefined unless it is loaded here. I suspect this could be fixed by having debugger's
    helper.js be written in TypeScript with proper export function. TODO(nifong): investigate this -->
