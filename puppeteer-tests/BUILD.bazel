# conjunction with disabling Puppeteer's automatic downloading behavior in //.puppeteerrc.json,
# this guarantees that we get a Chrome version that is known to work well with Puppeteer, and that
# it is placed in a predictable location.
#
# This rule behaves like a fancy genrule, and can be depended upon by other targets as if it were a
# filegroup. See https://docs.aspect.build/rulesets/aspect_rules_js/docs/js_run_binary.
