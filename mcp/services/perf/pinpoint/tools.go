				"For example, 2d98fb0e9f9f0fdb24c78d8fd29a8a0b029852ba or 2d98fb0 for full or short form respectively from " +
				"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/. This is a required field.",
			Required: true,

			Name: BenchmarkFlagName,
			Description: "The benchmark of interest to run. " +
				"For example, press benchmarks commonly refer to one of \"speedometer3.crossbench\", \"jetstream2.crossbench\" or \"motionmark1.3.crossbench\". " +

			Description: "The bot configuration refers to a tester (or test builder) on the Perf waterfall to run the benchmarks on.  " +
				"A tester maps 1:1 with a specific device type. For example, the tester \"mac-m3-pro-perf\" refers " +
				"to testing a benchmark on Mac M3 Pro devices.",

				"For try, this is the experiment (or B) of an A/B comparison. " +

			Name: IterationFlagName,
			Description: "The number of iterations to run the benchmark. " +
				"Higher iterations usually yield more granular benchmark results, but at the tradeoff of consuming " +
				"(and holding onto) additional resources. This value defaults to 10. The recommmended value for try jobs " +
