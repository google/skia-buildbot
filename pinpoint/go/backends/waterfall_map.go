// Builds from waterfall can also be recycled for bisection
//
// As part of our anomaly detection system, Waterfall builders
// will continuously build Chrome near the tip of main. Sometimes,
// Pinpoint jobs will attempt to build a CL Waterfall has already
// built i.e. verifying a regression. These builds are automatic.
// Pinpoint builders will only build Chrome on demand. The Waterfall
// and Pinpoint builders are maintained in separate pools.
//
// The map is maintained here:

// TODO(b/316207255): move this builder map to a more stable config file
