"""This module defines the cipd_install repository rule.

The cipd_install repository rule hermetically installs a CIPD package as an external Bazel
repository.

Files in the CIPD package can be added as dependencies to other Bazel targets in two ways: either
individually via a label such as "@my_cipd_pkg//:path/to/file", or by adding
"@my_cipd_pkg//:all_files" as a dependency, which is a filegroup that includes the entire contents
of the CIPD package. The contents of the generated BUILD.bazel file which facilitates this are
configurable, e.g. multiple smaller packages.

Note: Any files with spaces in their names cannot be used by Bazel and are thus excluded
from the generated Bazel rules.

If a Bazel target adds a CIPD package as a dependency, its contents will appear under the runfiles
directory. Example:

```
# WORKSPACE
cipd_install(
    name = "git_amd64_linux",
    build_file_content = all_cipd_files(),
    cipd_package = "infra/3pp/tools/git/linux-amd64",
    sha256 = "36cb96051827d6a3f6f59c5461996fe9490d997bcd2b351687d87dcd4a9b40fa",
    tag = "version:2.29.2.chromium.6",
)

# BUILD.bazel
go_library(
    name = "git_util.go",
    srcs = ["git_util.go"],
    data = ["@git_amd64_linux//:all_files"],
    ...
)

# git_util.go
import (
    "path/filepath"

    "go.skia.org/infra/bazel/go/bazel"
)

func FindGitBinary() string {
    return filepath.Join(bazel.RunfilesDir(), "external/git_amd64_linux/bin/git")
}
```

Note that runfile generation is disabled on Windows by default, and must be enabled with
--enable_runfiles[2] for the above mechanism to work.

        build_file_content: CIPD packages do not come with BUILD.bazel files, so we must supply

        cipd_package: The full name of the CIPD package. This is a "path" from the root of CIPD.
                      This should be a publicly accessible package, as authentication is not
                      supported.

                official CIPD website.
